#this function implements the kalman prediction step of our localizing robot
# inputs:
#   transition: is a data structure containing several things,
#               coming from the simulator
#               of these we are interested only in the offset
#               accessible through the "v" field of the structure
#
#               transition.v(1)=offset x
#               transition.v(2)=offset y (ignore for a diff drive robot)
#               transition.v(3)=offset theta
#  mu: is the mean of (x,y,theta) the previously estimated robot pose
#  sigma: is the covariance of the previously estimated robot pose (3x3 matrix)

# outputs
# [mu, sigma] are mean and covariance of the estimate after transition
